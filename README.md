# Quantum Study
     Classical computers use bits to represent and process information, whereas quantum computers use qubits. 
       1. A bit is a binary digit, meaning it can only be in one of two states: 0 or 1
       2. A qubit can exist in a superposition of states, meaning it can be 0, 1, or any combination of both simultaneously

# Basics Notions of quantum mechanics
     Q mechanics is theory making predictions about staticstics of microscopic objects. 
     Measurements of objects occur with relative frequencies and are distributed around a mean value.
       Mean= (Number of values) / (Sum of all values)
